Recently (november 2003) there is a wrapper system for OpenAL.
It searches for .dll files called *openal*.dll and loads them, thinking it is an implementation
of OpenAL32. This does not work with the previous library name of this project (openalpp.lib/.dll).
So for now it is called open++al.dll. Its not a nice name, but I cant find out any better solution to this
problem.
