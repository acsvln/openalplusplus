Small fixes for the filestreaming class. 
Changed the play method in sourcebase to not use array of linked sources.

2004-02-11 Anders Backman:

OpenAL++ used to depend on CommonC++, which caused problems as CommonC++ is GLP licensed, and OpenAL++ is LGPL which is not a valid situation. Therefore all dependency of CommonC++ is removed, for threading OpenThreads is used. This means that the netstreaming examples does not longer work.

Also the initial capital letter of method names is now changed to lower-case.
So a SetPosition() is now a setPosition()

Portaudio is not enabled by default anymore. 

2003-12-11 Anders Backman: 

Recently (november 2003) there is a wrapper system for OpenAL.
It searches for .dll files called *openal*.dll and loads them, thinking it is an implementation
of OpenAL32. This does not work with the previous library name of this project (openalpp.lib/.dll).
So for now it is called open++al.dll. Its not a nice name, but I cant find out any better solution to this
problem.
