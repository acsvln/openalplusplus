Installation instructions for OpenAL++
**************************************
OpenAL++ uses the libraries OpenAL, PortAudio and CommonC++. However, it is possible to compile OpenAL++ without PortAudio and CommonC++, but then some features will be disabled.

Linux/Unix
----------
Start by running configure ($ is the prompt):
 $ ./configure
This will create the Makefiles. Run configure --help to get information on the
(optional) arguments. Now make the library:
 $ make
If you want to generate documentation, do the following:
 $ make docs
This will create html, latex and man directories with the documentation.
The next step is to install. You probably have to log in as root to do this:
 $ su
 $ make install
If you have created documentation, the man-files can also be installed:
 $ make install-docs

By default, all the files will be installed under /usr/local (e.g. the include-files under /usr/local/include). This can be changed by using the --prefix flag for configure (e.g. configure --prefix=/usr).

Windows
-------
DISCLAIMER!!

Recently (november 2003) there is a wrapper system for OpenAL.
It searches for .dll files called *openal*.dll and loads them, thinking it is an implementation
of OpenAL32. This does not work with the previous library name of this project (openalpp.lib/.dll).
So for now it is called oalpp.dll. Its not a nice name, but I cant find out any better solution to this
problem.


OpenAL++ has been successfully compiled using Visual C++ 6.0/.NET2000/.NET2003. 
It should work using other compilers too.

There are three ways to compile and install OpenAl++. Whichever way you choose, you should make sure that the necessary paths (include, lib etc.) are correct. For example (in DOS) by using "set INCLUDE=%INCLUDE%;additional path here".
- 1 -
Open up the workspace (openalpp.dsw/openalpp.sln) in Visual C++.
Make sure openalpp is the active project (Build/Set Active Configuration. Openalpp - Win32 Release).
Be sure to set any include paths that might be necessary for PortAudio, CommonC++ and/or OpenAL. This can be done under Project/Settings/C/C++/Additional include directories.
Also, if you have installed libraries in "non-standard" places, additional library paths should be set under Project/Settings/Link/Input/Additional library path.
Build the library (hit F7)
The library and dll files are named oalpp.lib oalpp.dll and resides in the lib and the bin directory
in the project root.


Other platforms
---------------
OpenAL++ has not been tested on other platforms than Linux and Windows. If you get it to work on another platform, contact me with information on how you did, and I'll add information to this file. Also be sure to tell me about any necessary changes to configure.in and other files to get it to work.
