Installation instructions for OpenAL++
**************************************
OpenAL++ uses the libraries OpenAL, PortAudio and OpenThreads. However, it is possible to compile OpenAL++ without PortAudio, but then some features will be disabled.


Download
---------
Download OpenThreads from http://openthreads.sourceforge.net/ and install it.

If you want to use PortAudio for microphone capture (not very tested!) download that from: http://www.portaudio.com/ and install it.


Linux/Unix
----------
Start by running configure ($ is the prompt):
 $ ./autogen.sh
This will create the Makefiles. Run configure --help to get information on the
(optional) arguments. Now make the library:
 $ make
If you want to generate documentation, do the following:
 $ make docs
This will create html, latex and man directories with the documentation.
The next step is to install. You probably have to log in as root to do this:
 $ su
 $ make install
If you have created documentation, the man-files can also be installed:
 $ make install-docs

On some systems we have experienced problems with locking files. ("waiting for audioenvironment.o.lock) supplying --disable-libtool-lock to configure will remove that problem. This is done for you in the autogen.sh script.

By default, all the files will be installed under /usr/local (e.g. the include-files under /usr/local/include). This can be changed by using the --prefix flag for autogen.sh (e.g. ./autogen.sh --prefix=/usr).

Windows
-------
Portaudio is not included by default.
If you want to use it, edit config.h to reflect your usage.
Also you have to add the necessary includepath, libpath and library to the project.


DISCLAIMER!!

Recently (november 2003) there is a wrapper system for OpenAL.
It searches for .dll files called *openal*.dll and loads them, thinking it is an implementation
of OpenAL32. This does not work with the previous library name of this project (openalpp.lib/.dll).
So for now it is called oalpp.dll. Its not a nice name, but I cant find out any better solution to this
problem.


OpenAL++ has been successfully compiled using Visual C++ 6.0/.NET2000/.NET2003. 
It should work using other compilers too.

There are three ways to compile and install OpenAl++. Whichever way you choose, you should make sure that the necessary paths (include, lib etc.) are correct. For example (in DOS) by using "set INCLUDE=%INCLUDE%;additional path here".
- 1 -
Open up the workspace (openalpp.dsw/openalpp.sln) in Visual C++.
Make sure openalpp is the active project (Build/Set Active Configuration. Openalpp - Win32 Release).
Be sure to set any include paths that might be necessary for PortAudio, CommonC++ and/or OpenAL. This can be done under Project/Settings/C/C++/Additional include directories.
Also, if you have installed libraries in "non-standard" places, additional library paths should be set under Project/Settings/Link/Input/Additional library path.
Build the library (hit F7)
The library and dll files are named oalpp.lib oalpp.dll and resides in the lib and the bin directory
in the project root.


Other platforms
---------------
OpenAL++ has not been tested on other platforms than Linux and Windows. If you get it to work on another platform, contact me with information on how you did, and I'll add information to this file. Also be sure to tell me about any necessary changes to configure.in and other files to get it to work.
